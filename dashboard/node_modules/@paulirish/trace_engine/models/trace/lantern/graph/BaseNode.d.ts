 * nodes/be depended on. The construction of the graph maintains some important invariants that are
 * inherent to the model:
 *
 *    1. The graph is a DAG, there are no cycles.
 *    2. There is always a root node upon which all other nodes eventually depend.
 *
 * This allows particular optimizations in this class so that we do no need to check for cycles as
 * these methods are called and we can always start traversal at the root node.
